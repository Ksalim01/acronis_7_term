## Layout

Each problem has a dedicated directory. A file named `solution.h`
explains the interface to implement in a solution. A solution itself
must be implemented in `solution.c`. You may create additional source
files if needed.. A file named `main.c` invokes a solution. You may
modify it to run more tests of your own choice.
